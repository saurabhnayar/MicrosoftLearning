## Lab 03 – Canvas app

# Scenario

A regional building department issues and tracks permits for new buildings and updates for remodeling of existing buildings. Throughout this course you will build applications and automation to enable the regional building department to manage the permitting process. This will be an end-to-end solution which will help you understand the overall process flow.

As we continue to build our solution, we will now design a Power Apps canvas app that the inspectors will use in the Column on their mobile devices. Canvas apps are low code apps that can be designed for a tablet or mobile phone layouts. You will build a two-screen canvas app that allows inspectors quickly access and process the inspections.

# High-level lab steps

We will follow the below schema to design the canvas app:

- Create the app using the tablet form factor

- Connect to Microsoft Dataverse as a data source

- Configure a gallery control to show the pending inspections

- Use a Microsoft Dataverse view to populate the gallery

- Configure a detail page with inspection info

- Handle saving the inspection results to Microsoft Dataverse

- Export the solution with the data model and apps and import it to the “Production” environment

This is the first screen in the application to show all Pending Inspections for the logged in Inspector.

This second screen lets the inspector update the selected Inspection.

## Things to consider before you begin

- What would an inspector need quick access to while in the field?

- How do we move our solution from the development to the production environment?

- Remember to continue working in your DEVELOPMENT environment. We’ll move everything to production in Exercise 2 of this lab.
