## Lab 04 – Client Scripting

# Scenario

A regional building department issues and tracks permits for new buildings and updates for remodeling of existing buildings. Throughout this course, you will build applications and automation to enable the regional building department to manage the permitting process. This will be an end-to-end solution which will help you understand the overall process flow.

In this lab, you will implement client-side logic that will use the web API to evaluate the permit type associated with the permit record and use the client scripting API to manipulate the form controls. 

You will also customize the command bar to introduce a new lock permit button that will invoke a custom action to perform the lock permit logic. The server-side logic for the lock permit custom action will be implemented later in the course. Right now, you will just add the button and the logic to invoke the action.

## High-level lab steps

As part of building the client-side logic, you will complete the following:

- Setup a folder to contain your client script

- Upload and register the client script on the form

- Build logic to use the web API to retrieve the permit type record associated with the permit

- Build logic based on the permit type settings to hide and show the inspections tab on the form

- Build logic to set Columns as required/not required based on the permit type settings

- Use a community tool, Ribbon Workbench, to modify the command bar

- Build logic to invoke the lock permit custom action when the command bar button is clicked

## Things to consider before you begin

- Are there alternative designs that would be viable and not require code?

- Remember to continue working in your DEVELOPMENT environment. We will move everything to production soon.

# Exercise #1: Prepare and Load Resources

**Objective:** In this exercise, you will create, organize, and load your JavaScript web resources.

## Task #1: Use Visual Studio Code to Create Resources

In this task, you will set up a folder to contain the JavaScript web resource files in this course. 

1. If you do not already have Visual Studio Code, download it from here [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win) and install it.

2. Start **Visual Studio Code**. 

3. Create resources

	- Select Explorer from left menu or press Ctrl + Shift + E.

    ![Select Explorer - screenshot](../L04/Static/mod-01-client-scripting-01.png)

	- Click **Open Folder**.

	- Create a new folder and name it **ContosoClientScripts**.   
‎**Note:** This is the name and structure used for this lab, the platform does not require a specific structure or content organization. Many projects check these assets into a source control system to keep track of all the changes over the life of the client script.

	- Select the new folder you just created and click **Select Folder**.

    ![Select folder - screenshot](../L04/Static/mod-01-client-scripting-02.png)

            {var ContosoPermit = {__namespace: true};}
            if (typeof (ContosoPermit.Scripts) == "undefined")
            {ContosoPermit.Scripts = {__namespace: true};}

     ![Namespaces - screenshot](../L04/Static/mod-01-client-scripting-07.png)

    - Add the function mentioned below after adding the namespaces.

            ContosoPermit.Scripts.PermitForm = {
            __namespace: true
            }

    ![Add function - screenshot](../L04/Static/mod-01-client-scripting-08.png)
